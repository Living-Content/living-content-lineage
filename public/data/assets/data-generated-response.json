    "response": "Welcome to the National Gallery of Art collection! I'm delighted to guide you through what we have here.\n\nThis database contains **200 carefully curated artworks** from the National Gallery's Creative Commons Zero library. It's a wonderful cross-section of art history, spanning over five centuries — from Renaissance masterpieces dating back to 1508 all the way through to contemporary works from the late 20th century.\n\n## What You'll Find Here\n\nThe collection includes a rich variety of media:\n- **Paintings** from various periods\n- **Prints** showcasing different printmaking techniques like lithography and etching\n- **Drawings** capturing artistic vision in its most immediate form\n- **Etchings** with intricate detail work\n\n## Notable Highlights\n\nWe have significant holdings from the **Rosenwald Collection** — these are exceptional pieces donated by Lessing Julius Rosenwald. The collection also features both American and European artworks, giving you a transatlantic perspective on artistic development.\n\nEach artwork comes with detailed information including:\n- Artist attributions and creation dates\n- Provenance through credit lines\n- Physical dimensions\n- Unique identifiers and accession numbers\n\nThe range is quite impressive — from a 1508 Renaissance work *Vulcan, Venus, and Eros* to contemporary pieces like Joel Shapiro's 1989 *Untitled* and even works from the 1990s.\n\n**What interests you most?** Are you drawn to a particular period, artistic movement, or medium? I'd love to help you discover pieces that speak to your tastes.",
